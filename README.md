### Project Description

A web-based interactive experience where wise advice is typed into a textbox inside a buffalo's ear. When submitted, the buffalo opens its mouth, moos, and ignores your advice entirely ‚Äî a metaphor for talking to someone who never listens.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Some people never listen, no matter how wise or helpful your advice is. We needed a digital version of that experience.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We created a buffalo that takes your advice ‚Äî literally through its ear ‚Äî and responds with a dismissive "moo." Therapeutic and frustrating at the same time.
